         <p class="post-content">In 2008, the world saw the the first-of-its-kind book about the letter decoding of embroidered symbols on clothing and household items. Volodymyr Pidhirniak, the book’s author, called the book “Text embroidery. Brodivske lettering.” (published in Ukrainian).</p>
         <span class="post-content">Encryption looks like a modern QR code: each symbol hides a letter and a number that together create a unique charm pattern. Thereby, anyone can use such an embroidered alphabet and convey a message via ornaments. </span>

            <ul class="post-list">
                <li>The word "vyshyvanka" comes from the Ukrainian verb "vyshyvaty", which means "to embroider".</li>
                <li>The earliest known examples of Ukrainian embroidery date back to the 4th century BC.</li>
                <li>Embroidery was originally used as a way to protect the wearer from evil spirits</li>
                <li>The patterns on vyshyvankas often have symbolic meanings. For example, the red thread is often used to
                    represent the blood of Christ, while the black thread represents the earth</li>
                <li>The most common colors used in Ukrainian embroidery are red, black, and white.</li>

            <h4 class="post-content">Vyshyvanka in the collections of world clothing brands</h4>
            <p class="post-content">Exquisite embroidery, colourful drawn thread works, and original ethnic accessories are abundant on the catwalks and fashion week shows.
                This is not the first year Ukrainian designers have influenced European fashion. 
                Ukrainian designers confidently create fashion in various countries across the world using national ethnic elements. 
                For instance, Vita Kin is the creator of famous embroidered dresses and the first Ukrainian designer whose clothes have worn by the most influential global celebrities.
                Dita von Teese, Florence Welch, Demi Moore, and fashion insiders buy Vita Kin’s embroidered dresses. </p>

                <p class="post-content">The Ukrainian national dress, the vyshyvanka, has become a popular trend in world
                fashion in recent years.</p>
            <p>Several top clothing brands have included embroidered garments in their collections, inspired by the
                traditional Ukrainian designs.</p>
            <p>One of the first designers to use vyshyvanka motifs was Jean-Paul Gaultier. After visiting Ukraine in
                2005, he was inspired by the Orange Revolution and created a collection of embroidered clothes. The
                models in the show wore outfits named after Ukrainian cities, such as Kyiv, Bukovyna, and Crimea.</p>
            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">The Ukrainian national dress is a beautiful and unique tradition, and it
                is exciting to see it being celebrated by designers around the world.</p>
